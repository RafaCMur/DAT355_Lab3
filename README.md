# DAT355_Lab3

The ECORE model is in the file "mindstormsEcoreEditAndEditorProjectsInOne.zip" and it has got the edit and editor modules already generated.
About the other two projects, one is the viewpoint and the other is the model instance

The second projects is about greek gods in the Olympus and the relation between them. Same structure as the previous project, but instead of images I used
shapes (squares for the gods, blue circles for the sky beasts and red circles for the hell beasts.
