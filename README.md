# DAT355_Lab3

The first project is about a moving robot that we have to design. It has several actions like goForward, rotate, grab and release. All of them are instructions that belong to a coreography.

The second project is about greek gods in the Olympus and the relation between them. Same structure as the previous project, but instead of images I used
shapes (squares for the gods, blue circles for the sky beasts and red circles for the hell beasts.

To import the projects into the obeo designer, import them directly as a zip file.

Example with mindstorms. You have to import the 3 files "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms" "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms.edit" "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms.editor" into the obeo designer comunity. Then you need to create a run configuration using the "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms", run it, a new window will be opened. It will be another obeo designer window and there you can import the other 2 files "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms.design" and "fr.obeo.dsl.tuto.mindstorms.sample".
